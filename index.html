      <p>
        I am a currently a stay at home mom.  I have two children who are active in school and sports. 
        <br>
        Our sports are year round sports here in sunny Florida.  Even though they participate in year round sports, my husband and I understand the importance of multiple sport athletes.  
        We are not raising our kids for sports scholarships, (although, they would love to play sports in college).  It is not our goal.  Sports teach our kids hard work through fun.  
        To our family, sports is an outlet.  They are a way to get to know people, work on team building skills and individual growth.  We love the foundation and the structure most sports create for our kids.
        Most importantly, sports are fun.  Sports are a game, with life lessons embedded.
